# pypartition
Cuttings and partition tree code for generating small samples for halfspaces.
This is code from the paper "Practical Low Dimensional Half Space Range Space Sampling". It can be used to generate partition trees like the ones from Chan's "Optimal Partition Trees". The main file is partitions.py.
